## Craftlance

This is the app.

Craftlance is based on the problem of convenience. It is convenient to get any kind of service done for you from your phone. That is why we thought of our idea for our app.

The app is meant to help people find a person that can do their chores or provide some kind of service. Our users can post jobs or accept jobs.
This will be especially useful for students that are searching for a short-term job.

Example: someone wants to find a waiter for a day, he posts it on our app and people apply. When the work is finished, our client will pay the waiter and rate him.
